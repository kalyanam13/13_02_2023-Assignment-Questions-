    "### Note: Here Exception class refers to the base class for all the exceptions.\n",
    "### Answer: When creating a custom exception in Python, it is recommended to inherit from the Exception class, which is the base class for all built-in exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheriting from the Exception class allows your custom exception to have access to all the properties and methods of the base class, such as __str__ and __repr__, which are useful for creating a string representation of the exception when it is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additionally, using the Exception class as a base class ensures that your custom exception is compatible with the existing exception handling mechanisms in Python. When you raise a custom exception that inherits from the Exception class, it can be caught by any try/except blocks that are set up to catch exceptions of that type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Therefore, using the Exception class as a base class while creating a custom exception is considered good practice as it provides the necessary functionalities and ensures compatibility with existing exception handling mechanisms."

    "\n",
    "### 1. Be specific: Catch only the exceptions that you expect to be raised and avoid using a broad exception such as Exception or BaseException.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Use try-except blocks: Use a try-except block to catch exceptions and handle them in a meaningful way. This helps to prevent your program from crashing or returning incorrect results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Provide informative error messages: When an exception occurs, provide an informative error message that explains what went wrong and how to fix it. This will help users to understand what happened and take corrective actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Use finally block: Use a finally block to clean up resources such as closing files, releasing database connections, etc. This ensures that the resources are always released even if an exception is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Don't suppress exceptions: Avoid suppressing exceptions by catching them and not doing anything. This can make it difficult to diagnose problems and can result in unexpected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Raise custom exceptions: When developing libraries or modules, raise custom exceptions to make it easier for users to understand what went wrong and how to handle it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Use context managers: Use context managers such as the with statement to ensure that resources are properly managed and exceptions are handled appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Use logging: Use the logging module to log error messages and exceptions. This can help you diagnose problems and troubleshoot issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Test your code: Test your code with both expected and unexpected inputs to ensure that it handles exceptions appropriately and returns the expected results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### By following these best practices, you can write Python code that is more robust, maintainable, and user-friendly."
